    # Psuedu transaction support for ActiveModel based classes. Useful for when using a database that does not support
    # real transactions (such as MongoDB). These are basic client-only
    # transactions where all actual save operations are batched and commited at once. This allows you to save multiple
    # objects in sequence without having to first check that they are all valid.
    # Transactions will only fail if any of the records are invalid.
    # You must use save or save! method in order for the save operations to be registered with the
    # transaction. destroy is also supported. Atomic and update methods are not supported due to conflicting
    # with transaction use cases. Instead of using update_attributes, try assign_attributes and then save or save!.
    #
    # This feature also supports Redis mutex locking. When adding a
    module UnitOfWorkable
